**Important**: A mnemonic phrase and Public Key will be displayed. Save it in a safe place! Store the key pair securely in a local ``key_store.json`` file, This is the only way to recover your key if it's lost.

# Importing a Key Pair
If you saved your mnemonic previously, you can import it to ``key_store.json`` by using following command:

```
soundness-cli import-key --name <name> --mnemonic "<mnemonic>"
```
Edit ``<name>`` to the name you used while generating it and Edit ``"<mnemonic>"`` to your mnemonic phrase

# Link Public Key to Discord
